      "  1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water, clear broths, and electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut water or sports drinks.\n",
      "  2. **Avoid trigger foods**: Some foods can trigger or worsen vertigo symptoms. Common culprits include:\n",
      "  \t* Spicy or fatty foods\n",
      "  \t* Caffeine\n",
      "  \t* Chocolate\n",
      "  \t* Citrus fruits or juices\n",
      "  \t* Tomatoes or tomato-based products\n",
      "  \t* Fermented foods like yogurt, cheese, or kimchi\n",
      "  3. **Choose gentle proteins**: Opt for cooked, lean proteins like chicken, fish, or eggs.\n",
      "  4. **Incorporate soothing ingredients**: Include foods with anti-inflammatory and calming properties, such as:\n",
      "  \t* Ginger (in tea, soup, or stir-fry)\n",
      "  \t* Turmeric (in curries or soups)\n",
      "  \t* Fennel (in teas or salads)\n",
      "  \t* Bananas (easy to digest and rich in potassium)\n",
      "  5. **Eat small, frequent meals**: Divide your daily food intake into 4-6 smaller meals to reduce discomfort and nausea.\n",
      "  6. **Avoid heavy, greasy foods**: Steer clear of fried foods, rich sauces, and high-fiber foods that can worsen vertigo symptoms.\n",

      "🏋️ AI-Generated Workout Plan:\n",
      "  I can't provide a workout plan that may exacerbate vertigo symptoms. However, I can offer some general guidance on gentle morning exercises that might help improve balance and overall well-being while managing vertigo.\n",
      "\n",
      "  For individuals with vertigo, it's essential to start slowly and gently, avoiding any movements that trigger symptoms. Here's a 7-day morning workout plan that focuses on gentle exercises to help improve balance and reduce dizziness:\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 1\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Gentle neck stretches (slowly tilt head to the side, then back, repeating 5 times)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 2\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Seated leg raises (raise one leg 6-8 inches off the ground, hold for 5 seconds, and slowly lower it back down, repeating on the other side)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 3\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Wall push-ups (stand with feet shoulder-width apart, place hands on a wall at shoulder height, and slowly lower body toward the wall, pushing back up to the starting position)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 4\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Gentle arm circles (hold arms straight out to the sides and make small circles with hands for 5 repetitions in each direction)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 5\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Seated marching (sit comfortably with feet flat on the floor, lift one leg off the ground and march in place, repeating on the other side)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 6\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Gentle shoulder rolls (roll shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion for 5 repetitions)\n",
      "\n",
      "  # Day 7\n",
      "  - Morning Workout: Standing with support (hold onto a chair or wall for balance while standing upright, taking small steps forward and backward)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have vertigo. They can help you develop a personalized plan that suits your needs and abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Additionally, consider the following general tips to manage vertigo symptoms during exercise:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Start slowly and gently\n",
      "  * Avoid sudden movements or changes in position\n",
      "  * Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after exercise\n",
      "  * Take regular breaks to rest and recover\n",
